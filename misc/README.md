This directory contains Rocq files corresponding closely to the paper:
A bargain for mergesorts â€” How to prove your mergesort correct and stable, almost for free.

- [`Section3.v`](Section3.v) is the Rocq formalization of Section 3, that
  provides:
  + the simpler version of the characteristic property that work only for
    non-tail-recursive mergesorts (Section 3.2),
  + the proofs that the insertion sort (Definition 3.1), top-down mergesort
    (Figure 2a), and bottom-up mergesort (Figure 2b) satisfy the characteristic
    property (Section 3.3), and
  + generic correctness proofs (Section 3.4), including all the lemmas listed in
    Appendix B.
- [`Section4_1.v`](Section4_1.v) is the Rocq formalization of top-down
  tail-recursive mergesort, that provides:
  + a Rocq implementation of top-down tail-recursive mergesort (Section 4.1) and
  + the proof that it satisfies the characteristic property provided by
    [`stablesort.v`](../theories/stablesort.v) (Section 4.3.2).
- [`AppendicesAB.v`](AppendicesAB.v) provides:
  + a list of basic definitions and lemmas in the MathComp library (Appendix A)
    and
  + a list of lemmas stating the functional correctness of stable sort functions
    (Appendix B).

  A large part of this file just redefines and re-exports the contents of the
  MathComp library and [`stablesort.v`](../theories/stablesort.v); that is, this
  file has a significant overlap with them. Nevertheless, this file is supposed
  to serve as a self-contained index of the definitions and lemmas listed in
  Appendices A and B.
- [`AppendixC.v`](AppendixC.v) is the Rocq formalization of Section 3.4.3 and
  Appendix C, that provides:
  + The proofs of the stability results in literature (Lemmas C.1 and C.2),
    showing that they are easy consequences of our stability result (mainly
    Theorem 3.16), and
  + The converse proof that Lemma C.1 implies a slighly less-general version
    Theorem 3.11 and Theorem 3.16, under some assumptions on `sort`.
- [`AppendixD.v`](AppendixD.v) provides the definitions of
  structurally-recursive mergesort functions presented in Appendix D, which are
  copies of the implementations (excluding proofs) of mergesort functions in
  [`stablesort.v`](../theories/stablesort.v), with some stylistic modifications,
  e.g., replacing `seq` with `list`, and adding `{struct ..}` annotations.
